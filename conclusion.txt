Our nationâ€™s businesses and organization face an issue today that put our economy, as 
well as overall security, at risk. Through the convenience of cyberspace, we have left ourselves 
open to theft, espionage and a slew of other threats. In short, we need to overcome the legal 
barriers preventing the sharing of information. This information is vital to improving the security 
of all U.S. businesses and preventing loss of money. I hope I have convinced you to consider the 
importance of cybersecurity and its economic impact on our businesses.
